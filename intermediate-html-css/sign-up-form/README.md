# Odin Project - Sign Up Form  

## Goals  

Combine the stuff I've learned (or was supposed to have learned) so far to build a nice looking sign-up page for a fictional website.  

Get some practice with input validation.  

## Requirements  

- two columns of content  
  1. background image with logo and credit overlay  
  2. basic text + sign up form    

- form with validation for matching passwords, non-empty fields, proper e-mail, phone nuber  

- cool visual indicator for when currently in form -> looks like blue-ish shadow, slight pop-up  
- similar (red) one for invalid entry
